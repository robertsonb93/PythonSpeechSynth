#trainSet looks like:
#[glottisOld ,glottisNew ,VTP,numFrames ,frameRates ,incisors ,tubeLens ,velum ,audio]




#lets see if we can get it to match a single sound.
#the outputs from the learner are:

#   Values for each vocalTractParam
#   Values for each starting state GlottisParam
#   Number of Frames for the sound
#   How fast the Frames play
#   Lengths for each tube
#   Distance from the glottis to the incisors (front teeth)
#   Then area in cm2 of the velum
#   The End state Glottis paramns

#The input to the learner would be the desired sound

#The feedback/error is what is generated by the VTL model from the networks given parameters.
